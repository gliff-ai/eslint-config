üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the ESLint configuration that is shared for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs projects. 

This repository aims to clearly share our ESLint configuration used in [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai) projects with contributors. This lint is designed to find and fix problems by analysing our JavaScript code to find problems like programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs and then can automatically fix many of the issues flagged.

‚ùå **This repository does not accept most contributions unfortunately! However, an issue can still be raised if you recognise a problem you wish to bring to the gliff.ai teams attention.** ‚ùå
